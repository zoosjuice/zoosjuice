# Hi there 👋 I'm David.

I've been on a thoughful mission to educate the everyday people about finance and the tech-world we live in. Follow me as I navigate the world of VC from being a tech-nerd making apps to investing in tech companies for the greater good.

Here are helpful things to get you started:
